# TShock-Gatekeeper
TShock gatekeeper, i don't really know what to put here. This is literally a gatekeeper, if you have the pass you can enter the server else you'll be kicked by the gatekeeper.
This is just a glorified whitelist. Pretty useful when your server are under attack by persistent cheaters.

# Config file
